## ---Research---
### Using Geographic Information to Explore Player-Specific Movement and its Effects on Play Success in the NFL
[Publication](https://scholar.smu.edu/datasciencereview/vol7/iss2/3/)

Master’s research project explored the use of in-game NFL player movement data to develop machine learning models that predict play success on a play-by-play basis. The goal was to expand beyond existing use cases such as concussion detection, catch recognition, and completion percentage by incorporating player-specific movement attributes, including speed and agility. The paper discusses the results of a trained neural network used to predict play success and outlines potential applications with further development.

### [Cloud Shift: IT Audit](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/efa15d32ccfd477f5a0f5467b792ad6cbabde9fe/Cloud%20Shift-IT%20Audit.pdf)

This research focused on cloud computing governance and audit issues introduced by the growing organizational preference for cloud-first infrastructure. The shift to a cloud-first approach, which prioritizes cloud adoption, has led to the rapid expansion of cloud services. Accelerated further by organizational adjustments during the pandemic, cloud adoption has reduced IT costs and increased flexibility and efficiency, while also increasing the required level of trust placed in cloud vendors.

This data visualization presentation supported an increase in the minimum wage to $15. It utilized effective dashboard design principles emphasizing clear purpose, simplicity, and intentional design choices that make data easy to understand and compelling to act upon.



## ---Case Studies---
### [Ames Housing Data Analysis using SAS](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/d4739f7e27af5ddd3a05c56b9892170287d6ee15/Ames%20Iowa%20House%20Price%20Model.pdf)

In this project, we conducted two analyses using sample data from Ames, Iowa. In the first analysis, we developed a model to identify the factors that influence housing prices in Ames, Iowa. This analysis provides insight into which factors are most important for customers who are interested in buying a house in this area.

In the second analysis, we focused on building the most predictive model and demonstrated the process of variable selection using several methods, such as LASSO and stepwise selection. We selected the top three models for comparison and reported the adjusted R-squared, AIC, ASE (test), and Kaggle score for each model.

Finally, we selected two categorical variables and performed a two-way ANOVA to test both additive and nonadditive models.

### [Critical Temperature Linear Regression Model of Superconductor Materials](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/075ec271f2663676260ef0d6a6eb030ec7e2fdc1/Critical%20Temperature%20Linear%20Regression%20Model%20of%20Superconductor%20Materials.pdf)

This case study explored Linear Regression with L1 and L2 regularization and their impact on predicting the critical temperature of superconductor materials. Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regularization techniques were applied to combat overfitting. GridSearchCV was used to tune model hyperparameters.

### [Predicting Hospital Readmittance with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/d533489ba93c17960d992f80cc94e178adbeb634/Predicting%20Hospital%20Readmittance%20with%20Logistic%20Regression.pdf)

Hospital readmission occurs when a patient is discharged from a hospital and subsequently admitted again within a specific period. To promote efficiency within Medicare, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) as an amendment to the 1965 Social Security Act. This study used Logistic Regression to develop a model that helps hospitals identify patients at higher risk of readmission in order to avoid denied reimbursements and penalties.

### [Classifying Spam Emails Using Clustering and Naïve Bayes](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/efa15d32ccfd477f5a0f5467b792ad6cbabde9fe/Classifying%20Spam%20Emails%20Using%20Clustering%20and%20Na%C3%AFve%20Bayes.pdf)

Studies show that nearly half of all emails sent worldwide are spam, including cybersecurity threats and unsolicited bulk messages. These emails often attempt to sell unregulated goods or phish sensitive information such as passwords or credit card numbers. As spammers’ level of sophistication has increased, so has the use of malware and ransomware. This study used clustering and Naïve Bayes models to filter unsolicited emails and reduce the risk of sensitive information being compromised.

### [Predicting Bankruptcy using Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/efa15d32ccfd477f5a0f5467b792ad6cbabde9fe/Predicting%20Bankruptcy%20using%20Random%20Forest%20and%20Extreme%20Gradient%20Boosting.pdf)

This case study applied supervised machine learning techniques to predict corporate bankruptcy, a critical task in risk assessment that supports business continuity for partners, investors, lenders, and related entities. Since the economic collapse of 2008, the need to predict and avoid bankruptcy has increased, as failures of both large and small corporations can trigger cascading effects throughout financial markets.

### [Classifying Firewall Traffic using Support Vector Machine and Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/efa15d32ccfd477f5a0f5467b792ad6cbabde9fe/Classifying%20Spam%20Emails%20Using%20Clustering%20and%20Na%C3%AFve%20Bayes.pdf)

The rise of hacking, ransomware, phishing, and data leaks has increased the need for advanced methods to protect organizational data integrity. Firewalls play a critical role in network security by applying predefined rules to determine whether traffic should be allowed, dropped, denied, or reset. This case study explored the development of a machine learning-based classification system using Support Vector Machines and Stochastic Gradient Descent to efficiently approve or deny network traffic.

### [New Particle Detection using a Dense Neural Network](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/efa15d32ccfd477f5a0f5467b792ad6cbabde9fe/New%20Particle%20Detection%20using%20a%20Dense%20Neural%20Network.docx.pdf)

This case required the development of a model to predict the existence of a new particle. Given the emphasis on classification accuracy, a dense neural network classifier was selected as the primary modeling approach.

### [Developing Classification Model on Unknown Dataset](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/efa15d32ccfd477f5a0f5467b792ad6cbabde9fe/Developing%20Classification%20Model%20on%20Unknown%20Dataset.docx.pdf)

Using an anonymized dataset, this case study explored the development of a machine learning model to predict a binary target variable, y. This scenario reflects real-world data science challenges where models must be built with limited contextual information, such as with medical or classified datasets. The case also incorporated misclassification costs, requiring the model to minimize potential losses.
