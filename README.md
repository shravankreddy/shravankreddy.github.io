## Research
### Using Geographic Information to Explore Player-Specific Movement and its Effects on Play Success in the NFL
[Publication](https://scholar.smu.edu/datasciencereview/vol7/iss2/3/)

Master's research explores the use of in-game NFL player movement data to develop machine learning models to predict success on a play-by-play basis.  The goal was to extend the current use cases of concussion detection, catch recognition, and completion percentage and extend it to player-specific movement attributes, such as speed and agility, to analyze play success. Paper discusses the results of trained neural network for predicting play success and possible applications with additional development.

### Cloud Shift: IT Audit

Research focuses on cloud computing governance and audit issues introduced by the growing organizational preference of cloud first infrastructure.  The shift to a cloud first approach prioritizes cloud adoption has led to a rapid adoption of cloud services. Accelerated even more with adjustments to the pandemic, the cloud has not only reduced IT costs and increased flexibility and efficiency but also increased the required level of trust with cloud vendors

## Case Studies
### Critical Temperature Linear Regression Model of Superconductor Materials
[Case Study](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/075ec271f2663676260ef0d6a6eb030ec7e2fdc1/Critical%20Temperature%20Linear%20Regression%20Model%20of%20Superconductor%20Materials.pdf)

Case study explored Linear Regression with L1 and L2 regularization, and its impact on predicting the critical temperature of a superconductor. Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) are regularization techniques that combat overfitting in models. GridSearchCV was used to tune the hyper-parameters for these models.
