### Using Geographic Information to Explore Player-Specific Movement and its Effects on Play Success in the NFL
[Publication](https://scholar.smu.edu/datasciencereview/vol7/iss2/3/)

Master's research explores the use of in-game NFL player movement data to develop machine learning models to predict success on a play-by-play basis.  The goal was to extend the current use cases of concussion detection, catch recognition, and completion percentage and extend it to player-specific movement attributes, such as speed and agility, to analyze play success. Paper discusses the results of trained neural network for predicting play success and possible applications with additional development.
