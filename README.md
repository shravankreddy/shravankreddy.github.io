## Research
### Using Geographic Information to Explore Player-Specific Movement and its Effects on Play Success in the NFL
[Publication](https://scholar.smu.edu/datasciencereview/vol7/iss2/3/)

Master's research explores the use of in-game NFL player movement data to develop machine learning models to predict success on a play-by-play basis.  The goal was to extend the current use cases of concussion detection, catch recognition, and completion percentage and extend it to player-specific movement attributes, such as speed and agility, to analyze play success. Paper discusses the results of trained neural network for predicting play success and possible applications with additional development.

### [Cloud Shift: IT Audit](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/efa15d32ccfd477f5a0f5467b792ad6cbabde9fe/Cloud%20Shift-IT%20Audit.pdf)

Research focuses on cloud computing governance and audit issues introduced by the growing organizational preference of cloud first infrastructure.  The shift to a cloud first approach prioritizes cloud adoption has led to a rapid adoption of cloud services. Accelerated even more with adjustments to the pandemic, the cloud has not only reduced IT costs and increased flexibility and efficiency but also increased the required level of trust with cloud vendors

Data visualization presentation in support of an increase of the minimum wage to $15.  Utilized effective dashboard design principles emphasizing clear purpose, simplicity, and design choices that make data easy to understand and compelling to act on.

## Case Studies
### [Critical Temperature Linear Regression Model of Superconductor Materials](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/075ec271f2663676260ef0d6a6eb030ec7e2fdc1/Critical%20Temperature%20Linear%20Regression%20Model%20of%20Superconductor%20Materials.pdf)

Case study explored Linear Regression with L1 and L2 regularization, and its impact on predicting the critical temperature of a superconductor. Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) are regularization techniques that combat overfitting in models. GridSearchCV was used to tune the hyper-parameters for these models.

### [Predicting Hospital Readmittance with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/d533489ba93c17960d992f80cc94e178adbeb634/Predicting%20Hospital%20Readmittance%20with%20Logistic%20Regression.pdf)

Hospital readmission occurs when a patient has been discharged from a hospital but has been admitted within a specific period.  To help promote efficiencies within Medicare, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) as an addition to the 1965 Social Security Act.  This study used logistic regression to develop a model to help hospitals identify patients with higher risks of readmission in an effort to avoid denied reimbursements and penalties.

### [Classifying Spam Emails Using Clustering and Naïve Bayes](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/efa15d32ccfd477f5a0f5467b792ad6cbabde9fe/Classifying%20Spam%20Emails%20Using%20Clustering%20and%20Na%C3%AFve%20Bayes.pdf)

Studies show that nearly half of the emails sent worldwide are spam that include a wide range of cybersecurity threats and unsolicited messages sent in bulk.  These spam messages usually attempt to promote and sell unregulated goods or try to phish sensitive information, like a password or credit card numbers.  As spammers level of sophistication increased, so has the use of malware and ransomware.  This study used clustering and Naïve Bayes to develop models to filter unsolicited emails to prevent sensitive information being compromised.

### [Predicting Bankruptcy using Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/efa15d32ccfd477f5a0f5467b792ad6cbabde9fe/Predicting%20Bankruptcy%20using%20Random%20Forest%20and%20Extreme%20Gradient%20Boosting.pdf)

Using supervised machine learning to assist in predicting bankruptcies advances one of the most fundamental tasks in risk assessment that ensures business continuity with partners, investors, lenders, and other sector related entities. Since the economic collapse in 2008, there has been a greater need to predict and avoid bankruptcy. As evident from that crisis, bankruptcies of large and even small corporations can trigger a domino effect that can bring financial markets to a halt.

### [Classifying Firewall Traffic using Support Vector Machine and Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/efa15d32ccfd477f5a0f5467b792ad6cbabde9fe/Classifying%20Spam%20Emails%20Using%20Clustering%20and%20Na%C3%AFve%20Bayes.pdf)

Hacking, ransomware, phishing, and data leaks have created the need for methods to prevent these types of attacks that can compromise an organization's data integrity.  Firewalls, just one of many security features used to control traffic for a given network and play a crucial part in protecting against threats, use an established set of rules that consider different characteristics of a particular connection and determine which action to take on the connection (“Allow”, “Drop”, “Deny”, or “Reset-both”). Development of a classification system that can effectively and promptly approve or deny a traffic request was explored utilizing machine learning methods.

### [New Particle Detection using a Dense Neural Network](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/efa15d32ccfd477f5a0f5467b792ad6cbabde9fe/New%20Particle%20Detection%20using%20a%20Dense%20Neural%20Network.docx.pdf)

The case requires the development of a model to predict the existence of a new particle.  The focus on accuracy suggests a neural network with a classifier is the best approach. 

### [Developing Classification Model on Unknown Dataset](https://github.com/shravankreddy/shravankreddy.github.io/blob/efa15d32ccfd477f5a0f5467b792ad6cbabde9fe/Developing%20Classification%20Model%20on%20Unknown%20Dataset.docx.pdf)

Given an anonymized set of data, this case study explores the development of a machine learning model that can predict the binary target variable ‘y’.  This scenario of needing to develop a predictive model using data with little to no background can come up frequently in data science.  Sources that include medical patient data or classified data would require development with very little information. The scenario also comes with a misclassification cost so the model needs to minimize those losses.
